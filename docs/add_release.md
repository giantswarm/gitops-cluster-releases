# Add a new Workload Cluster release template

Workload Cluster releases are pre-configured cluster templates that you can use to easily create a cluster instance.

Depending on the infrastructure provider and release you want to use to create your new cluster, you might need either
a [Vintage cluster template](./add_release_vintage.md) or the new
[CAPI based cluster template](./add_release_capi.md). Please check these docs about how to add a template in each
of the cases.
